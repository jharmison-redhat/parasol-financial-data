Parasol Financial Documents
===

NOTE: These documents are a fictionalized version of publicly available documents online. There are statements made throughout them about copyright, legal obligations such as FDIC reporting, etc. and phone numbers, mailing addresses, and more - these statements are not true or accurate.

The purpose of this data set is to maintain a human-curated and realistic data set for fine-tuning language models, and augmenting queries to them, using a realistic and cohesive human-generated set of texts.

The documents are for research and training purposes, and they are provided in good faith. They will be used to facilitate conversations around capabilities with language models and their customization, within the existing fictional [Parasol conglomerate](https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/parasol-insurance).
